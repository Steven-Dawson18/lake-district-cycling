                <h2>Guide to cycling in the Lake District</h2>
                <p>
                The Lake District is a beautiful place to get out and explore but the roads can get very busy and dangerous to cycle on, particularly in the summer holidays. When the sun is shining there are few places we would like to be than cycling next to a lake or on a trail in the trees. But the problem is, where do you go? Well to answer that we have put together some of our favourite cycle rides for all abilities to suit everyone.
