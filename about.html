            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                Lake District Tykes Cycle is a website mainly about cycling with kids, my partner and I have collated some of our favourite cycle routes to do with our family of 6.  As parents of two young boys, one young girl and a dog we have been exploring our favourite places bike. At first it was a good way of getting the kids to go further as we walked but as they grew we also mounted our bikes. This led us to feel sorry for our dog who then couldn't explore with us, so we bought a K9 backpack and he can continue to explore with us!

            <p>Our family likes nothing more than to get out, explore and have fun! That is why we have created this website, so other families, like ours, can find exciting cycle routes and other activities to participate in. We have joined up with Grizedale Forest, Whinlatter Forest and Brathay Trust to offer you discounts on activities that they offer.

             <h2>Steve</h2>
             <p>With an Ba Hons in Physical Education and a passion for being active and exploring the countryside, it was inevitable that Steve would want to cycle with his children.  When the first child arrived wee ride child bike seat was the first purchase. Now, over 8 years later the children can ride and explore for themselves.</p>

            <h2>Our little tykes</h2>
            <p>Charlotte, Jack and William love nothing more than getting out in the fresh air of the lake district and exploring new cycle routes. They enjoy routes where there are places to stop and play and have picnics along the way.Their favoured cycle routes are those out of Grizedale and Whinlatter as there are more activities for them to do like Go Ape.</p>
