            <p>
                The Lake District is a beautiful plce to get out and explore but the roads can get very busy and dangerous to cycle on, particularly in the summer holidays. When the sun is shining there are few places we would like to be than cycling next to a lake or on a trail in the trees. Bbut the problem is, where do yoou go? Well to answer that we have put together some of our favourite cycle rides for all abilities to suite everyone.

                <h2>Wray Castle to Claife Viewing Station Cycle Trail</h2>
                <p>
                    Wray Castle to Claife viewing station trail route is an 8 mile long return, which is suitable for all abilities. It is an  ideal place to explore by bike, with beautiful lake views to be enjoyed from bridleways, which have gentle slopes and are mainly traffic-free. There are plenty of places for small children to stop and play along the way and beautiful grassy places to sit by the lake with a picnic at both ends. You can start at both ends with car parking in a national trust car park at either end of the trail. There are also refreshments at both Wray Castle and  Claire viewing station and an outdoor play area at Wray castle. There is a cost to enter Wray Castle but if you have a national trust card, entry is free, and there are lots of activities to do inside the castle. This is a great day out!

                <h2>Grizedale Forest - Mushroom trail</h2>
                <p>
                    Grizedale Forest is a young cyclists dream! There are plenty of activities available here and a variety of traffic-free trails for suitable for all abilities of riders. The Mushroom cycle trail is family friendly and is 3 miles long and is on even forest trails with slight inclines and descents.. Kids love navigating their way round the trail using the maps, available from the information centre, to find the wooden mushrooms scattered around the forest. There are plenty of places to stop for a picnic and the visitor centre has a lovely cafe and outdoor play area for the children!

                <h2>Whinlatter Forest - Gorse Cycle Trail</h2>
                <p>
                    This is our choice for a nice gentle family cycle ride at Whinlatter. It is 6 miles long mostly on well-surfaced forest paths. There are some gradual climb and decent’s on this route so the smallest riders may need to push at times. There are plenty of idilic views and places to stop for a picnic along the way as well as great facilities at the visitor centre.

                <h2>Whinlatter Forest - Quercus Trail</h2>
                <p>
                    Our choice for a slightly more adventurous ride at Whinlatter has to be the Quercus trail on which you can chose the 3 or 5 mile route. Our kids love this trail as they enjoy the flowing single track with gentle berms. There are also some more technical features along the route for the more adventurous riders to challenge themselves with. There are some nice places to stop and have a picnic and take in the scenic views on offer.

                <h2>The Grasmere Trail (10 miles return, moderate)</h2>
                <p>
                    Another favourite intermediate ride of ours is from Ambleside to Grasmere and back (about 10 miles). It is mostly off-road or on quiet lanes, taking you alongside Rydal Water and Grasmere towards Grasmere Village. There are some fantastic places to stop by Grassmerre and Rydal water where the kids can take there shoes off and go paddling to keep cool! The route is uneven and undulating, and takes in some short steep hills and descents which is why we have it as an intermediate route. You can start this ride from either Grasmere or Ambleside and from any car park of which there are many to choose from. We tend to start from Ambleside C of E Primary School

                <h2>The Black MTB trail</h2>
                <p>
                    We have chosen the Black MTB trail for the advanced riders as it gets our hearts going! While our children are not all quite ready for this route, our eldest loves the challenging herself on the steep decent’s offered on this route. The route also features umps and berms with steep descents, defiantly not for the faint hearted! It is only about 1 mile in length but, you have to get to the start first!

                <h2>Altura trail - challenging singletrack route</h2>
                <p>
                    The Altura trail is a purpose built trail for advanced riders. It is 12 miles long and has both steep inclines and decent’s so a good level of fitness is required. The route itself has difficult downhill sections and good off -road skills are a must. This is not one for the family but we have included it because every now and then you might get that day where you are free from parenting responsibilities!
